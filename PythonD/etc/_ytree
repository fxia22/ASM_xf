# The [DIRMAP] and [FILEMAP] sections allow keyboard keys to be remapped or unmapped
# in directory mode and file mode, respectively.  The comma-separated list of keys to
# the left of the "=" is remapped to perform the action specified by the character to
# the right of the "=".  If no character is specified, the keys are unmapped (do nothing).
######################################
# [DIRMAP]
# <B> or <b> in dir window mode is remapped to <a> key action (Attribute)               
# B,b=a
# <P> or <p> in dir window mode is remapped to <o> key action (Owner)               
# P,p=o

# [FILEMAP]
# <I> in file window mode is remapped to <v> key action (View)               
# i,I=v
# <G> in file window mode is remapped to <g>
# G=g
# ytree default assignment of <g> to "group" is removed
# g=

######################################
# The [DIRCMD] and [FILECMD] sections allow new command actions to be defined
# in directory mode and file mode, respectively.  The command to the right of
# the "=" is executed when the key to the right of the "=" is pressed.  If the
# key is mapped (either by the default ytree key assignments or by a [DIRMAP]
# or [FILEMAP] entry,) this mapping is followed after the command is executed.
# Thus to change FILE mode "g" from "group" to "gcc" requires both a FILECMD
# assignment "g=gcc -O -c" and a FILEMAP assignment "g=" (to remove the default
# action "group" from the "g" key.)
#
# If [command] contains the characters "%s", the selected <filepath> is
# substituted for "%s".  Otherwise, the selected <filepath> is appended to [command].
######################################
# [DIRCMD]
# <k> in dir window mode does "du <dirname> | less"               
k=du %s | less
# <K> in dir window mode does "echo <dirname> | less"               
K=echo %s | less
