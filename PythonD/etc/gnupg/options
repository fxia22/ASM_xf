# Unless you you specify which option file to use (with the
# commandline option "--options filename"), GnuPG uses the
# file ~/.gnupg/options by default.
#
# An option file can contain all long options which are
# available in GnuPG. If the first non white space character of
# a line is a '#', this line is ignored.  Empty lines are also
# ignored.
#
# See the man page for a list of options.

# Uncomment the next line to get rid of the copyright notice
#no-greeting

# If you have more than 1 secret key in your keyring, you may want
# to uncomment the following option and set your preffered keyid

#default-key 621CC013

# GnuPG ultimately trusts all keys in the secret keyring.  If you do
# not have all your secret keys online available you should use this
# option to tell GnuPG about ultimately trusted keys.
# You have to give the long keyID here which can be obtained by using
# the --list-key command along with the option --with-colons; you will
# get a line similiar to this one:
#    pub:u:1024:17:5DE249965B0358A2:1999-03-15:2006-02-04:59:f:
# the 5th field is what you want.

#trusted-key 12345678ABCDEF01


# If you do not pass a recipient to gpg, it will ask for one.
# Using this option you can encrypt to a default key.  key validation
# will not be done in this case.
# The second form uses the default key as default recipient.

#default-recipient some-user-id
#default-recipient-self


# The next option is enabled because this one is needed for interoperation
# with PGP 5 users.  To enable full OpenPGP compliance you have to remove
# this option.

force-v3-sigs

# Because some mailers change lines starting with "From " to ">From "
# it is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating
# cleartext signatures; all other PGP versions do it this way too.
# To enable full OpenPGP compliance you have to remove this option.

escape-from-lines

# If you do not use the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) charset, you should
# tell GnuPG which is the native character set.  Please check
# the man page for supported character sets. 
#charset utf-8


# You may define aliases like this:
#   alias mynames  -u 0x12345678 -u 0x456789ab -z 9
# everytime you use --mynames, it will be expanded to the options
# in the above defintion.  The name of the alias may not be abbreviated.
# NOTE: This is not yet implemented

# lock the file only once for the lifetime of a process.
# if you do not define this, the lock will be obtained and released
# every time it is needed - normally this is not needed.
#lock-once

# If you have configured GnuPG without a random gatherer
# (./configure --enable-static-rnd=none), you have to
# uncomment _one_ of the following lines.  These
# extensions won't get used if you have a random gatherer
# compiled in (which is the default for GNU and xxxBSD systems)
#load-extension rndlinux
#load-extension rndunix
#load-extension rndegd


# GnuPG can import a key from a HKP keyerver if one is missing
# for certain operations. Is you set this option to a keyserver
# you will be asked in such a case whether GnuPG should try to
# import the key from that server (server do syncronize with each
# other and DNS Round-Robin may give you a random server each time).
# Use "host -l pgp.net | grep www" to figure out a keyserver.
#
# If you do not want to use the default port 11371, you can give the
# name of the keyserver like this: 
#   x-hkp://keyserver.example.net:22742
# If you have problems connecting through a buggy proxy, you can use this:
#   x-broken-hkp://keyserver.example.net:11371
# But first you should make sure that you have read the man page regarding
# proxies (--honor-http-proxy)
# Most users just set the name of the preferred keyserver.
#keyserver wwwkeys.nl.pgp.net

# The environment variable http_proxy is only used when the
# this option is set.

#honor-http-proxy
