# Service-order for DNS name lookups. Use `hosts' first. If name not
# in `hosts' file send a DNS request to nameserver(s).
# NOT YET IMPLEMENTED; order is always "hosts,bind".
# For IPv6, order is always "hosts6, bind6, hosts, bind".
#
# host.conf = order hosts, bind

#
# Configuration of bind resolver. These settings are active only if
# library was compiled with USE_BIND (ref. .\src\config.h) and using
# any of the resolver functions in <resolv.h>.
#
# HOSTALIASES points to a file which lists host aliases, e.g:
#  alfie.somewhere.net www.somewhere.net
#  blondie.foo.net     mail.mci.net
