	<P>
	  The <A HREF="http://www.egenix.com/">eGenix.com</A> mx
	  Extensions for Python are a collection of professional
	  quality Python software tools which enhance <A
	  HREF="http://www.python.org/">Python</A>'s usability in many
	  important areas such as ODBC database connectivity, fast
	  text processing, date/time processing and web site
	  programming.

	<P>
	  The tools have a proven record of being portable across many
	  Unix and Windows platforms, e.g. you can write applications
	  which use an ODBC database on Windows which then run on Unix
	  platforms without change due to the consistent platforms
	  independent interfaces.

	<P>
	  All of the available packages have shown their stability
	  and usefulness in many mission critical applications and
	  various commercial settings all around the world.

	<P>
	  The two most well-known packages from the mx Extension
	  Series are <A HREF="#mxDateTime">mxDateTime</A> and <A
	  HREF="#mxODBC">mxODBC</A> providing date/time services and
	  professional ODBC database connectivity on practically all
	  supported Python platforms. These two packages enable
	  database software which is portable not only across
	  platforms, but also across database backends.

    <UL>

	<P>
	  The eGenix.com mx BASE package contains the Open Source
	  parts of the eGenix.com mx Extension series. They are
	  shipped under the new <A
	  HREF="mxLicense.html#Public">eGenix.com Public License
	  Agreement Version 1.0.0</A>. This license is an enhanced
	  version of the Python 2.0 license and allows you to use and
	  redistribute the <I>eGenix.com mx BASE</I> package in
	  commercial and non-commercial applications without having to
	  pay a fee or royalties.

	<P>
	  The following subpackages are included in the BASE package:

    <A NAME="mxDateTime">

    <H4><A HREF="mxDateTime.html">mxDateTime - Generic Date/Time Types</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxDateTime is an extension package that provides three new
	  object types, DateTime, DateTimeDelta and RelativeDateTime,
	  which let you store and handle date/time values in a much
	  more natural way than by using ticks (seconds since 1.1.70
	  0:00 UTC; the encoding used by the time module).
	
	<P>
	  You can add, subtract and even multiply instances, pickle
	  and copy them and convert the results to strings, COM dates,
	  ticks and some other more esoteric values. In addition,
	  there are several convenient constructors and formatters at
	  hand to greatly simplify dealing with dates and times in
	  real-world applications.

	<P>
	  In addition to providing an easy-to-use Python interface the
	  package also exports a comfortable C API interface for other
	  extensions to build upon. This is especially interesting for
	  database applications which often have to deal with
	  date/time values (the <A HREF="#mxODBC">mxODBC</A> package
	  is one example of an extension using this interface).

    </UL>

    <A NAME="mxTextTools">

    <H4><A HREF="mxTextTools.html">mxTextTools - Fast Text Processing Tools</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxTextTools is an extension package for Python that provides
	  several useful functions and types that implement
	  high-performance text manipulation and searching algorithms
	  in addition to a very flexible and extendable state machine,
	  the Tagging Engine, that allows scanning and processing text
	  based on low-level byte-code "programs" written using Python
	  tuples.  It gives you access to the speed of C without the
	  need to do any compile and link steps every time you change
	  the parsing description.

	<P>
	  Applications include parsing structured text, finding and
	  extracting text (either exact or using translation tables)
	  and recombining strings to form new text.

    </UL>
      
    <A NAME="mxStack">

    <H4><A HREF="mxStack.html">mxStack - Fast and Memory-Efficient Stack Type</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxStack is an extension package that provides a new object
	  type called Stack. It works much like what you would expect
	  from such a type, having .push() and .pop() methods and
	  focusses on obtaining maximum speed at low memory costs.

    </UL>
    
    <A NAME="mxTools">

    <H4><A HREF="mxTools.html">mxTools - Collection of Additional Builtins</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxTools is an extension package that includes a collection
	  of handy functions and objects giving additional
	  functionality in form of new builtins to the Python
	  programmer.

	<P>
	  The package auto-installs the new functions and objects as
	  builtins upon first import. This means that they become
	  instantely available to all other modules without any
	  further action on your part. Add the line <CODE>import
	  mx.Tools.NewBuiltins</CODE> to your site.py script and they
	  will be available to all users at your site as if they were
	  installed in the Python interpreter itself.

    </UL>
    
    <A NAME="mxProxy">

    <H4><A HREF="mxProxy.html">mxProxy - Generic Proxy Wrapper Type</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxProxy is an extension package that provides a new type
	  that is suitable to implement Bastion like features without
	  the need to use restricted execution environments. 

	<P>
	  The type's main features are <I>secure data
	  encapsulation</I> (the hidden objects are not accessible
	  from Python since they are stored in internal C structures),
	  <I>customizable attribute lookup</I> methods and a
	  <I>cleanup protocol</I> that helps in breaking circular
	  references prior to object deletion.

	<P>
	  The latest version adds a very interesting new feature:
	  <I>weak references</I> which help you work with circular
	  references in a way that doesn't cause memory leakage in a
	  Python system.

    </UL>

    <A NAME="mxBeeBase">

    <H4><A HREF="mxBeeBase.html">mxBeeBase - On-disk B+Tree Based Database Kit</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxBeeBase is a high performance construction kit for disk
	  based indexed databases. It offers components which you can
	  plug together to easily build your own custom mid-sized
	  databases (the current size limit is
	  <CODE>sizeof(long)</CODE> which gives you an address range
	  of around 2GB on 32-bit platforms).

	<P>
	  The two basic building blocks in mxBeeBase are
	  <I>storage</I> and <I>index</I>. Storage is implemented as
	  variable record length data storage with integrated data
	  protection features, automatic data recovery and locking for
	  multi process access. Indexes use a high performance
	  optimized B+Tree implementation built on top of <A
	  HREF="http://epaperpress.com/">Thomas Niemann</A>'s Cookbook
	  B+Tree implementation.

    <UL>
    
	<P>
	  On Unix systems supporting the <B>RPM formats</B> the
	  package can be installed using the standard operating system
	  tools, e.g. <CODE>rpm -i egenix-mx-base-xxxx.rpm</CODE> will
	  install the package and <CODE>rpm -e
	  egenix-mx-base-xxxx</CODE> deinstall it. When installing
	  packages for multiple Python versions, be sure to first
	  install the RPM for the oldest Python version and then
	  proceed with the more recent ones (or use the
	  <CODE>--force</CODE> option to install them in any order).
	  Note that the above RPMs install the extensions into
	  /usr/ not /usr/local/ !

	<P>
	  On <B>Windows platforms</B> the preferred method for
	  installation is using the the Windows installer, since this
	  doesn't require a C compiler to be installed on the system.
	  Thanks to Thomas Heller the installer also support uninstall
	  using the standard Windows uninstall procedure.

	<P>
	  All other platforms can use the <A
	  HREF="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/">distutils</A>
	  based installation which allows building and installing the
	  package using the installed Python interpreter and the
	  standard system C compiler.  On such a system, unzip the
	  package archive to a temporary directory and then run
	  <CODE>python setup.py install</CODE> to install the package
	  and <CODE>python setup.py uninstall</CODE> to uninstall it
	  again.  Documentation about the usage of distutils (which is
	  part of Python since version 2.0) is available online at the

	<P>Changes from 2.0.3 to 2.0.4:

	<UL>

	    <LI> RPMs now install to /usr/ instead of
	    /usr/local/. This change was necessary to resynch to the
	    standard Python RPMs.

            <P><LI> The mx distutils build system was updated to the
            latest version.

	</UL>

	<P>Changes from 2.0.2 to 2.0.3:

	<UL>

	    <LI> Some cleanup of assignments to __debug__ which
            cause warnings in Python 2.1.

            <P><LI> Added some missing header files. These are needed
            by third party tools in case they rely on the provided C
            interfaces.

            <P><LI> <B>Changed</B> the error class object fullnames to
            properly include the complete package path.

            <P><LI> Corrected a bug in the free list management of the
            various types which showed up when using pymalloc.

            <P><LI> Prepared the tools for Python 2.2.

	</UL>

	<P>Changes from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2:

	<UL>

	    <LI> Added compiler support for Cygwin. Thanks to Mark
	    Hadfield for pointing out the necessary changes.

	    <P><LI> Reworked the RPM packaging for different Python
	    versions: you can now install the RPMs for different
	    Python versions side-by-side.

	    <P><LI> Updated a few packages, e.g. the mxDateTime
	    package.

	</UL>

	<P>Changes from 2.0.0 to 2.0.1:

	<UL>

	    <LI> Added back .h header files to the
	    mx-subdirectories. Third-party software was relying on
	    these files, but the distutils process did not include
	    them per default.

	    <P><LI> New release for Python 2.1.

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxODBC is an extension package that provides a Python
	  Database API compliant interface to ODBC capable database
	  drivers and managers (supported ODBC versions are 2.0 -
	  3.5).

	<P>
	  In addition to the capabilities provided through the
	  standard DB API it also gives access to a rich set of
	  catalog methods which allow you to scan the database for
	  tables, procedures, etc.  Furthermore, it uses the
	  mxDateTime package for date/time value interfacing
	  eliminating most of the problems these types normally
	  introduce (other in/output formats are available too).

	<P>
	  The new version does not only allow you to interface to more
	  than one database from one process, it also comes with
	  <B>support for Unicode</B> (which was added to Python in
	  version 2.0).
	  
	<P>
	  The source package includes a varity of preconfigured setups
	  for many commonly used databases such as MySQL, Oracle,
	  Informix, Solid and many more. Precompiled versions of the
	  extension for use with the Windows ODBC manager and the Unix
	  iODBC manager are also available.

		  The <B>Windows installer</B> only includes the

		  download the correct installer for your Python
		  version, otherwise you won't be able to install the
		  packages.
		  <P>

		<LI>
		  The <B>Linux binary RPMs</B> only include the

		  HREF="http://www.unixODBC.org/">unixODBC Driver
		  Manager</A>). You normally have these installed on
		  your system if you happen to use an ODBC capable
		  database on your Linux machine. When installing
		  packages for multiple Python versions, be sure to
		  first install the RPM for the oldest Python version
		  and then proceed with the more recent ones (or use

		  <P>

	<P>
	  On Unix systems supporting the <B>RPM formats</B> the
	  package can be installed using the standard operating system
	  tools, e.g. <CODE>rpm -i
	  egenix-mx-commercial-xxxx.rpm</CODE> will install the
	  package and <CODE>rpm -e egenix-mx-commercial-xxxx</CODE>
	  deinstall it. If you don't have both iODBC and unixODBC
	  installed on your system, you should try to run <CODE>rpm -i
	  --nodeps egenix-mx-commercial-xxxx.rpm</CODE>. This will
	  skip the dependency checks and forces an install even though
	  RPM cannot find all required libs.

	<P>
	  On <B>Windows platforms</B> the preferred method for
	  installation is using the the Windows installer, since this
	  doesn't require a C compiler to be installed on the system.
	  Thanks to Thomas Heller the installer also support uninstall
	  using the standard Windows uninstall procedure.

	<P>
	  All other platforms can use the <A
	  HREF="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/">distutils</A>
	  based installation which allows building and installing the
	  package using the installed Python interpreter and the

	  alpha or beta state and does not meet the quality standards
	  of production quality software.

	<P>
	  The following subpackages are included in the EXPERIMENTAL package:

    <A NAME="mxNumber">

    <H4><A HREF="mxNumber.html">mxNumber - Extended Numeric Types</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxNumber is an extension package which provides access to a
	  new set of basic numeric types. 

	<P>
          The package uses the <A
          HREF="http://http://www.swox.com/gmp/">GNU Multi-Precision
          Library (GMP)</A> as basis for providing this functionality
          at high performance on a wide range of platforms including
          all Unix and Windows platforms. This library is licensed
          under the Library GNU Public License (LGPL) which means that
          it does not have the viral character as the standard GPL
          does. It usable with software which is not GPL-compatible,
          such as closed-source commercial software.

	<P>
	  This mxNumber package is licensed under the <A
	  HREF="mxLicense.html#Public">eGenix.com Public License
	  Agreement Version 1.0.0</A>; the Windows package also
	  includes a pre-compiled version of the <A
	  HREF="http://http://www.swox.com/gmp/">GNU Multi-Precision
	  Library (GMP)</A> which eGenix.com ported to Windows. The
	  patches needed for porting GMP to Windows are also included
	  in the source package.

	<P>
          <B>Note:</B> mxNumber relies on the new coercions features
          in Python 2.1. Older Python versions are not supported and
          mxNumber won't run with these versions.
	      

    </UL>

    <A NAME="mxTidy">

    <H4><A HREF="mxTidy.html">mxTidy - Interface to HTML Tidy (HTML/XML cleanup tool)</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxTidy provides a Python interface to a thread-safe, library
	  version of the <a
	  href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/">HTML Tidy</a>.
	  command line tool.

	<P>
	  HTML Tidy helps you to cleanup coding errors in HTML and XML
	  files and produce well-formed HTML, XHTML or XML as output.
	  This allows you to preprocess web-page for inclusion in XML
	  repositories, prepare broken XML files for validation and
	  also makes it possible to write converters from well-known
	  word processing applications such as MS Word to other
	  structured data representations by using XML as intermediate
	  format.

    </UL>

    <A NAME="mxURL">

    <H4><A HREF="mxURL.html">mxURL -  An URL Datatype</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxURL provides a new datatype for storing and
	  manipulating URL values as well as a few helpers related to
	  URL building, encoding and decoding.

	<P>
	  The main intention of the package is to provide an easy to
	  use, fast and lightwheight datatype for Universal Resource
	  Locators (note the W3C now calls these URIs).

    </UL>

    <A NAME="mxUID">

    <H4><A HREF="mxUID.html">mxUID -  An UID Datatype</A></H4>

    <UL>

	<P>
	  mxUID provides a fast mechanism for generating universal
	  identification strings (UIDs). The intent is to make these
	  UIDs unique with high probability in order to serve as
	  object or data set identifiers.
	 
	<P>
	  A typical use lies in generating session IDs. Other areas
	  where unique IDs play an important role are
	  RPC-implementations, ORBs, etc.

    <H4>Installation</H4>

    <UL>
    
	<P>
	  On Unix systems supporting the <B>RPM formats</B> the
	  package can be installed using the standard operating system
	  tools, e.g. <CODE>rpm -i
	  egenix-mx-experimental-xxxx.rpm</CODE> will install the
	  package and <CODE>rpm -e egenix-mx-experimental-xxxx</CODE>
	  deinstall it. When installing packages for multiple Python
	  versions, be sure to first install the RPM for the oldest
	  Python version and then proceed with the more recent ones
	  (or use the <CODE>--force</CODE> option to install them in
	  any order).

	<P>
	  On <B>Windows platforms</B> the preferred method for
	  installation is using the the Windows installer, since this
	  doesn't require a C compiler to be installed on the system.
	  Thanks to Thomas Heller the installer also support uninstall
	  using the standard Windows uninstall procedure.

	<P>
	  All other platforms can use the <A
	  HREF="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/">distutils</A>
	  based installation which allows building and installing the
	  package using the installed Python interpreter and the
	  standard system C compiler.  On such a system, unzip the
	  package archive to a temporary directory and then run
	  <CODE>python setup.py install</CODE> to install the package
	  and <CODE>python setup.py uninstall</CODE> to uninstall it
	  again.  Documentation about the usage of distutils (which is
	  part of Python since version 2.0) is available online at the
	  <A
	  HREF="http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/doc/">distutils
	  documentation</A> site.
