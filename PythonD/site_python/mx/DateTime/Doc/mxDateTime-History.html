    <H3>Old History Entries</H3>

    <UL>

	<P> These are the really old history entries for those interested
            in how mxDateTime discovered the world of split seconds...

	<P>Things that changed from 0.8.4 to 0.9.0:

	<P><UL>

            <LI>Added oneWeek constant.

            <P><LI>Added ISO submodule for interfacing to ISO date and
            time representations.

            <P><LI>Added ISO.Week() constructor and .iso_week attribute
            to DateTime objects. (Hope I got that right...)

            <P><LI>Added gmticks method, a test to make sure
            ticks(offset,dst) always returns proper values for dst = 0
            and dst = 1 and documentation on the possible error
            conditions that can occur when using these. The gmticks
            method is only available if the platform provides the
            timegm() C API.  <I>Currently, you will have to edit the
            Setup file to enable/disable the HAVE_TIMEGM compiler flag
            -- the next Python version (>1.5.1) will do the check for
            you.</I>

            <P><LI>Fixed gmticks() to first try datetime.gmticks() and
            only revert to the ticks offset method if it is not
            available.

            <P><LI><B>Changed API for mktime():</B> the arguments are
            no longer defined as keywords and it now excepts three
            additional arguments to be call compatible to time.mktime().

            <P><LI>Added string parsing constructors to ISO that
            handle the most common cases of ISO string representation.

            <P><LI>Added ARPA submodule for parsing Internet dates.

        </UL>

	<P>Things that changed from 0.8.3 to 0.8.4:

	<P><UL>

            <LI>Added gmticks() and new parameters to the
            ticks()-method. This should make storing and retrieving
            UTC-time values a little easier.

        </UL>

	<P>Things that changed from 0.8.2 to 0.8.3:

	<P><UL>

            <LI>Fixed a small bugglet that caused the module not to
            compile with compilers that have problems with static
            forward declarations.

            <P><LI>Trimmed down the DateTime object size by a few bytes.

            <P><LI>Fixed the mxDateTime/__init__.py module to import
            all symbols from the extension module mxDateTime. This
            used to confuse some users.

        </UL>

	<P>Things that changed from 0.8.1 to 0.8.2:

	<P><UL>

            <LI>Added today().

            <P><LI>DateTime.tuple() now tries to determine the DST
            value assuming the stored value is given in local time.

            <P><LI>DateTime instances now have two extra attributes:
            datetime.dst is an integer stating if the given time uses
            DST or not and datetime.tz returns a timezone string.

            <P><LI>Reduced the pickle size for both types by providing
            function name shortcuts for the unpickling routines.

            <P><LI>The functions localtime() and gmtime() now return
            the current time rounded to the nearest micro-second.
            This makes un/pickling the current time more reliable (rounding
            errors become less likely).

            <P><LI>Added methods needed for the copy protocol as
            defined by the copy module: __copy__ and
            __deepcopy__. Since both types have immutable instances
            these functions merely return a new reference to the
            instance. Thanks to <I>Stephane Bidoul</I> for suggesting
            this addition.

            <P><LI>Fixed the documentation a little.

	</UL>

	<P>Things that changed from 0.8 to 0.8.1:

	<P><UL>

            <LI>Fixed a typo that caused conversion from DateTime
            to ticks using the ticks()-method to be off by one hour in
            summertime.


	</UL>

	<P>Things that changed from 0.7 to 0.8:

	<P><UL>

	    <LI><B>Important change:</B> Conversions from and to Unix
	    time values (ticks) are now done assuming the broken down
	    values represent <I>local time</I>, not UTC as in previous
	    versions.  now() returns local time instead of UTC -- this
	    was confusing to some users. The change had to be done since
	    I didn't want to carry the timemodule.c stuff all along the
	    way... the method I used to convert from mktime() output to
	    UTC was flaky anyway.

	    <P><LI><B>Important for programmers</B> wanting to use the C
	    interface: I dropped the direct access macros in the
	    mxDateTime header file. If you want to access the broken
	    down representation of the instances from C, use the new
	    DateTime[Delta]_BrokenDown() APIs. I did this, because I may
	    decide to put the two types on a diet in a next version
	    (i.e.  dropping the cached broken down values).

	    <P><LI>Added an alias 'Format' for the method
	    DateTime.strftime. This makes the DateTime type compatible
	    with the existing PythonWin date type.

	    <P><LI>DateTime.strftime() defaults to '%c' as format string if
	    no parameters are given.

	    <P><LI>Dropped the plan to add keywords handling: it would
	    produce a noticable performance hit due to the way keyword
	    handling works in the interpreter.

	    <P><LI>Dropped the module specific ConversionError in favour of
	    the standard OverflowError. Conversion to ticks will raise
	    an OverflowError in case the converted value doesn't fit
	    into the machines time value format.

	    <P><LI>Moved some constructors and objects from mxDateTime to
	    DateTime. You won't notice any difference if you are using
	    the DateTime interface (which you should), except the fact
	    that some functions are now coded in Python rather than C.

	    <P><LI>The TimeDelta() constructor now accepts keywords. This
	    is a side-effect from moving it out of the C module into the
	    Python package module. You can now write <TT>twoMinutes =
	      TimeDelta(minutes=2)</TT>.

	    <P><LI>Added an experimental ODMG submodule that uses date/time
	    classes built on top of the two basic types. The main
	    difference is that they support timezone offsets.

	    <P><LI>Added support for storing COM dates
	    as-is. DateTimeFromCOMDate(x).COMDate() will always return x
	    unchanged.

	</UL>

	<P>Things that changed from 0.6 to 0.7:

	<P><UL>

	    <LI>To make the transition from usage of time values to
	    usage of the new types easier, they can convert themselves
	    to floats and integers on demand (e.g. with float() or
	    int()). The DateTime instances return their value in ticks,
	    the DateTimeDelta instances in seconds. The necessary
	    conversion can cause a ConversionError to be raised in case
	    the objects value doesn't fit into the converted types
	    range.

	    <P><LI>Since it is sometimes needed to have the date/time value
	    stored in one number (begin sufficiently accurate to hold a
	    vast range of dates), interfaces to both types were added
	    that return the internal value as days Python float (maps to
	    a C double). The fraction part is calculated using a 86400.0
	    seconds/day basis and does not account for leap seconds.

	    <P><LI>Fixed a bug in the value of the constant Epoch. The
	    epoch for this module is 1.1.0001 0:00:00.00 and not
	    1.1.0001 0:00:01.00.

	    <P><LI>Added code from Modules/timemodule.c (found in the 1.5
	    Python distribution) that allows now() to return fractions
	    of a second.

	    <P><LI>Added __members__ attribute to both types. The builtin
	    dir() function will now tell you what attributes the types
	    have.

	    <P><LI>The module now defines a cleanup function which it
	    registers with Py_AtExit(). This will free the free lists
	    upon finalization of the interpreter.

	    <P><LI>Added #ifdefs and #defines to make the module more
	    portable to platforms which don't provide the C lib
	    functions strftime() and strptime(). These interfaces are
	    only available on platforms which provide the corresponding
	    C functions. <I>You may have to enable them manually (see
	      mxDateTime.c) on platforms other than Unix.</I>

	    <P><LI>When converting the date/time values to the
	    representation used by the C API strftime(), seconds are now
	    rounded to the next integer (the struct tm defines second as
	    being an integer, thus fraction parts can not be displayed).

	    <P><LI>Changed the default date/time representation for str()
	    and repr() to ISO format. I previously used the strftime()
	    C-API but that has the disadvantage of not displaying
	    fractions of a second which can lead to representations off
	    by up to 0.5 seconds.

	    <P><LI>The second attributes of both types now return floats
	    instead of integers.

	</UL>

	<P>Things that changed from 0.5 to 0.6:

	<P><UL>

	    <LI>The constructor DateTimeDeltaFromTicks has been renamed
	    to DateTimeDeltaFromSeconds, since the old name was
	    misleading (ticks being a seconds since the epoch
	    value). The corresponding C API's was dropped, since there
	    already is a function providing the same functionality
	    (DateTimeDelta_FromDaysAndSeconds with 0 days).

	    <P><LI>The installation structure now uses a package
	    layout. The package is called <TT>DateTime</TT> and imports
	    the C extension mxDateTime.

	    <P><LI>Fixed a bug causing overflow errors for larger deltas.

	    <P><LI>Fixed a bugglet that prevented the module from being
	    used inside packages.

	    <P><LI>Fixed a naming bug in mxDateTime.h. The interface for
	    DateTimeDelta now also uses function names without the 'mx'
	    prefix. Changed DateTimeDelta_AsTicks to
	    DateTimeDelta_AsDouble (see note above).

	    <P><LI>The DateTimeDelta API now also provides low-level
	    macros, like the DateTime API.

	    <P><LI>Fixed a bug in DateTimeDelta() and in the str()/repr()
	    routines that caused a core dump for very large deltas,
	    e.g. DateTimeDeltaFromSeconds(-443243329200.0).

	    <P><LI>Made the two types pickleable. Importing the package
	    registers them via <TT>copy_reg</TT>.

	    <P><LI>Added free lists for both types reducing the number of
	    free/malloc calls necessary.  If you don't want these lists,
	    have a look at the top of the C file.

	    <P><LI>Fixed a bug that caused comparing numbers and instances
	    to always returned 0 (meaning equal).

	</UL>

	<P>Interface change from 0.4 to 0.5 (thanks to <I>Greg
	Stein</I> for suggesting many of these changes): 

	    <P><UL>

	    <LI>The as_XXX methods have been renamed and some of them
	    now return more information (that's why they were renamed,
	    so an exception will be raised in case you still use them).

	    <P><LI>Further attributes were added to DateTimeDelta
	    objects. Because of this the method as_ticks and
	    as_timetuple have been dropped.

	    <P><LI>The DateTime constructor now takes arguments year,
	    month, day, hour, minute, second instead of just absolute
	    days and seconds. The old constructor is still available,
	    but the name has been changed to DateTimeFromAbsDateTime().

	    <P><LI>The constructors Date(), Time() and Timestamp() are just
	    different names for DateTime(), TimeDelta(), DateTime()
	    resp.

	    <P><LI>The str() and repr() outputs have changed. These now use
	    a format that should be usable in most standard situations.

	    <P><LI>The DateTimeDelta attributes hour, minute, second now
	    return negative values for negative time deltas.

	</UL>

	<P>The change index starts with version 0.4, the first one
	  that also provided a type for time values.

	<P>
