	<P>
	  The mx Extensions Series packages are brought to you by the
	  eGenix.com Software, Skills and Services GmbH, Langenfeld,
	  Germany.  We are licensing our products under the following
	  two different licenses:
	<UL>
	  <LI><A HREF="#Public">eGenix.com Public License</A>
	  <LI><A HREF="#Commercial">eGenix.com Commercial License</A>.
	</UL>

	<P>
	  The <I>Public License</I> is very similar to the Python 2.0
	  license and covers the open source software made available
	  by eGenix.com which is free of charge even for commercial
	  use.

	<P>
	  The <I>Commercial License</I> is intended for covering
	  commercial eGenix.com software, notably the mxODBC
	  package. Only private and non-commercial use is free of
	  charge.

	<P>
	  If you have questions regarding these licenses, please
	  contact <A
	  HREF="mailto:licenses@eGenix.com">Licenses@eGenix.com</A>.
	  If you would like to bundle the software with your
	  commercial product, please write to <A
	  HREF="mailto:sales@eGenix.com">Sales@eGenix.com</A>
	  for more information about the redistribution conditions and
	  terms.

    <UL>

	<P>
	  The eGenix.com Public License is similar to the Python 2.0
	  and considered an Open Source license (in the sense defined
	  by the <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source
	  Intiative (OSI)</A>) by eGenix.com.

	<P>
	  The license should also be compatible to the <A
	  HREF="http://www.gnu.org">GNU Public License</A> in case
	  that matters. The only part which is known to have caused
	  some problems with Richard Stallmann in the past is the
	  choice of law clause.

<H3> EGENIX.COM COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT         VERSION 1.0.0 </H3>
<P>
<H4> 1. Introduction </H4>
<P>
This "License Agreement" is between eGenix.com Software, Skills and
Services GmbH ("eGenix.com"), having an office at Pastor-Loeh-Str. 48,
D-40764 Langenfeld, Germany, and the Individual or Organization
("Licensee") accessing and otherwise using this software in source or
binary form and its associated documentation ("the Software").
<P>
<H4> 2. Terms and Definitions </H4>
<P>
The "Software" covered under this License Agreement includes without
limitation, all object code, source code, help files, publications,
documentation and other programs, products or tools that are included
in the official "Software Distribution" available from eGenix.com.
<P>
The "Proof of Authorization" for the Software is a written and signed
notice from eGenix.com providing evidence of the extent of
authorizations the Licensee has acquired to use the Software and of
Licensee's eligibility for future upgrade program prices (if
announced) and potential special or promotional opportunities. As
such, the Proof of Authorization becomes part of this License Agreement.
<P>
Installation of the Software ("Installation") refers to the process of
unpacking or copying the files included in the Software Distribution
to an Installation Target.
<P>
"Installation Target" refers to the target of an installation
operation.  Targets are defined as follows:
<P>
    1) "CPU" refers to a central processing unit which is able to
    store and/or execute the Software (a server, personal computer, or
    other computer-like device) using at most two (2) processors,
<P>
    2) "Site" refers to at most one hundred fifty (150) CPUs installed
    at a single site of a company,
<P>

    installed at an unlimited number of sites of the company,
<P>
    4) "Developer CPU" refers to a single CPU used by at most one (1)
    developer.
<P>
When installing the Software on a server CPU for use by other CPUs in
a network, Licensee must obtain a License for the server CPU and for
all client CPUs attached to the network which will make use of the
Software by copying the Software in binary or source form from the
server into their CPU memory. If a CPU makes use of more than two (2)
processors, Licensee must obtain additional CPU licenses to cover the
total number of installed processors. Likewise, if a Developer CPU is
used by more than one developer, Licensee must obtain additional
Developer CPU licenses to cover the total number of developers using
the CPU.
<P>
"Commercial Environment" refers to any application environment which
is aimed at producing profit. This includes, without limitation,
for-profit organizations, work as independent contractor, consultant
and other profit generating relationships with organizations or
individuals.  
<P>
"Non-Commercial Environments" are all those application environments
which do not directly or indirectly generate profit.  Educational and
other officially acknowledged non-profit organizations are regarded as
being a Non-Commercial Environment in the above sense.
